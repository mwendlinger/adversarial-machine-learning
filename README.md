# Adversarial machine learning playground

First started as a practical course investigating robust machine learning concepts, specifically the so-called cross-generalization gap following the paper *More Data Can Expand the Generalization Gap Between Adversarially Robust and Standard Models*   
Chen et al. [2020] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04725.pdf)

Extended the given environment by different L_p norms and their respective effects on robust learning.
